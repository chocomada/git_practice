Falling down, falling down.)(Mary had a little lamb,
Its fleece was white as snow.)

poen = (In the quiet of the night,
Underneath the stars so bright,
Whispers float upon the air,
Telling tales of love and care.) (Nature's lullaby gently sings,
As the moon its light it brings,
Dreams dance in the silent space,
Where worries vanish without a trace.)
(Roses are red, violets are blue,
Sugar is sweet, and so are you.)
